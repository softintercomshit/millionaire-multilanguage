//These constants are defined in iTunesConnect, and will function as long
//  as this sample is built/run with the existing bundle identifier
//  (com.appledts.GKTapper).  If you want to experiment with this sample and
//  iTunesConnect, you'll need to define you're own bundle ID and iTunes
//  Connect configurations.  This sample uses reverse DNS for Leaderboards
//  and Achievement IDs, but this is not a requirement.  Any string that
//  iTunes Connect will accept will work fine.
